# hello-world
my name is charles im 32 years old and i dont know the least bit about programming
I would like to get to know how to do this coding stuff. 
is there anyone who might be able to help me?
ive been having alot of issues with my cell phone lately.
it has been hacked several times. and i cant root my device to try and fix it.
I can look at the coding of the phone through recovery logs
and i believe i have found where the hack came from.
